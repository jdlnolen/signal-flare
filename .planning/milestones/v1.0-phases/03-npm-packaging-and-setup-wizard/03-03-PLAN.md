<objective>
Create polished README with Slack app creation guide and MIT license.

Purpose: The README is the front door of the project. A developer should go from "never heard of Signal Flare" to "receiving first Slack notification" in under 10 minutes by following the README alone.
Output: Complete README.md with demo GIF placeholder, features, Slack app guide, installation, setup, troubleshooting. MIT LICENSE file.

  <action>
**README.md** -- Professional but friendly tone per locked decision. No screenshots (they go stale). Structure:

1. **Title and tagline**: "Signal Flare" with one-line description: "When Claude Code needs you and you're not watching the terminal, Signal Flare gets the message to you in Slack."

2. **Demo GIF placeholder**: Add an HTML comment `<!-- TODO: Add demo GIF showing: Claude asks question -> Slack notification -> reply -> Claude continues -->` and a placeholder image reference: `![Signal Flare Demo](./docs/demo.gif)` -- the actual GIF is a deferred deliverable.

3. **Features section** (bullet list):
   - Ask Human via Slack: Claude sends questions to Slack, gets your reply back
   - Task completion notifications: Know when Claude finishes
   - Error alerts: Get notified about tool failures
   - Question detection: If you don't respond in terminal within 90s, notification fires in Slack
   - Rich Block Kit messages with urgency color coding
   - One-command setup wizard

4. **Quick Start** (numbered steps, the "10-minute path"):
   1. Create a Slack app (link to section below)
   2. `npm install -g signal-flare`
   3. `signal-flare setup`
   4. Restart Claude Code
   5. `signal-flare test` to verify

5. **Creating Your Slack App** (detailed, numbered steps with exact menu paths):
   1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and click "Create New App" > "From scratch"
   2. Name it (suggest "Signal Flare" or "Claude Notifications"), select workspace
   3. Navigate to "OAuth & Permissions" in the sidebar
   4. Under "Bot Token Scopes", add these scopes:
      - `chat:write` -- Send messages
      - `channels:history` -- Read message replies (for polling)
      - `channels:read` -- Verify channel access
   5. Click "Install to Workspace" at the top of the page, authorize
   6. Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token" (starts with `xoxb-`)
   7. Create or choose a Slack channel for notifications
   8. Get the Channel ID: right-click the channel name > "View channel details" > scroll to bottom, copy the ID (starts with `C`)
   9. Invite the bot to the channel: in the channel, type `/invite @YourBotName`
   10. (Optional) Get your User ID for @mentions: click your profile picture > "Profile" > three dots menu > "Copy member ID"

6. **Installation**:
   ```
   npm install -g signal-flare
   ```
   Requirements: Node.js 18+

7. **Setup**:
   ```
   signal-flare setup
   ```
   Explain what it does: prompts for tokens, validates, writes config to Claude Code settings.

8. **CLI Commands** (brief reference):
   - `signal-flare setup` -- Interactive configuration wizard
   - `signal-flare test` -- Send a test notification to verify setup
   - `signal-flare status` -- Show current configuration and connection state

9. **How It Works** (brief, 2-3 paragraphs):
   - MCP server provides `ask_human_via_slack` tool that Claude can call
   - Hook handlers fire on session end (Stop), tool errors (PostToolUseFailure), and question detection (PermissionRequest with idle timeout)
   - All communication goes through your own Slack app -- no third-party servers

10. **Configuration** (env vars table):
    | Variable | Required | Description |
    |----------|----------|-------------|
    | SLACK_BOT_TOKEN | Yes | Bot token (xoxb-...) |
    | SLACK_CHANNEL_ID | Yes | Channel for notifications |
    | SLACK_USER_ID | No | Your user ID for @mentions |
    | SIGNAL_FLARE_ENV_FILE | No | Path to .env file (set by wizard) |
    | HOOK_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS | No | Idle timeout before Slack escalation (default: 90000) |
    | POLL_TIMEOUT_MS | No | MCP tool poll timeout (default: 600000) |

11. **Troubleshooting** (top 6 issues per locked decision):
    - "Missing SLACK_BOT_TOKEN" error -- Run `signal-flare setup` or check .env file path
    - Bot not posting to channel -- Ensure bot is invited to the channel (`/invite @BotName`)
    - "channel_not_found" error -- Verify channel ID starts with C, check bot has channels:read scope
    - Hooks not firing -- Check `signal-flare status`, verify ~/.claude/settings.json has hook entries, restart Claude Code
    - MCP tool not available -- Check `signal-flare status`, verify ~/.claude.json has mcpServers entry, restart Claude Code
    - No Slack notification for questions -- Idle timeout is 90s by default; the notification only fires if you don't respond in terminal within that window

12. **License**: MIT -- see LICENSE file

13. **Contributing**: Brief note that this is a personal project, issues/PRs welcome on GitHub.

**LICENSE** -- Standard MIT license text with year 2026 and "Signal Flare Contributors" as copyright holder.
